# Cognitive Cities Architecture - Neurological Mapping

This document provides a comprehensive mapping between the neurological architecture diagram (`System-5-CNS-ORG.png`) and the GitHub implementation of the Cognitive Cities system.

## Overview

The Cognitive Cities architecture translates the human nervous system's cognitive processes into a distributed microservices system. Each brain region, neural pathway, and cognitive function has a corresponding software service or component.

## Neurological Architecture Reference

![Neurological Architecture](System-5-CNS-ORG.png)

The reference diagram shows the Company & Nervous System Integration, adapted from Science and Cosmic Order, featuring three main processing triads that mirror human cognitive architecture.
