## 🌐 Integration Function Affected

**Neurological Mapping**: This issue affects the Central Nervous System Integration (Neural Pathways & Communication)

- [ ] **🌐 API Gateway** - Central nervous system routing and coordination
- [ ] **📡 Event Bus** - Inter-triad neural pathway communication
- [ ] **🔗 Cross-Triad Communication** - Information flow between brain regions
- [ ] **📚 Shared Libraries** - Common cognitive infrastructure
- [ ] **🚀 System Deployment** - Complete cognitive system orchestration

## 🔍 Integration Description

**What integration or communication function is not working?**

Describe the specific cross-system communication, routing, or coordination that is failing.

## 🌐 Expected Integration Behavior

**How should the neural pathways be communicating?**

Detail the expected information flow between triads or system components.

## 🚫 Actual Integration Behavior

**What is the integration actually doing instead?**

Describe the current (incorrect) communication or coordination behavior.

## 🧠 Neural Pathway Context

**Cross-triad communication details:**
- **Source triad**: (Cerebral, Somatic, Autonomic, External)
- **Target triad**: (Cerebral, Somatic, Autonomic, External)
- **Communication type**: (REST API, Event Bus, WebSocket, Direct)
- **Message flow**: (Request-response, Event-driven, Stream, Batch)
- **Data format**: (JSON, XML, Binary, Protocol Buffer)

## 🌐 Integration Context

- **Component affected**: (e.g., API Gateway, Event Bus, Service Mesh)
- **Port/Endpoint**: (e.g., 3000/api/*, Message Queue, Service Discovery)
- **Integration layer**: Central nervous system coordination
- **Protocol**: (HTTP, WebSocket, Message Queue, gRPC)
- **Network topology**: (Internal, External, Cross-cluster)

## 🔄 Reproduction Steps

1. Initiate cross-triad communication via...
2. Route request through API Gateway...

4. Check service discovery and routing...
5. Verify end-to-end integration...

## 📊 Integration Impact Assessment

**Neural Communication Impact:**
- [ ] **🔴 Critical**: Complete communication breakdown (system isolation)
- [ ] **🟠 High**: Major integration failure (triads cannot communicate)
- [ ] **🟡 Medium**: Degraded cross-triad communication (latency/errors)
- [ ] **🟢 Low**: Minor integration issue (cosmetic or performance)

## 🧠 Affected Neural Pathways

**Which brain region communications are impacted?**

### Cerebral ↔ Somatic Communication
- [ ] **Executive → Motor**: Decision-making to action execution
- [ ] **Motor → Executive**: Feedback from behavioral responses
- [ ] **Status**: (Working, Degraded, Broken)

### Somatic ↔ Autonomic Communication  
- [ ] **Motor → Autonomic**: Performance data to monitoring
- [ ] **Autonomic → Motor**: System health to behavioral control
- [ ] **Status**: (Working, Degraded, Broken)

### Autonomic ↔ Cerebral Communication
- [ ] **Autonomic → Executive**: System state to decision-making
- [ ] **Executive → Autonomic**: Strategic direction to background processing
- [ ] **Status**: (Working, Degraded, Broken)

## 🌐 System-Wide Effects

**Complete cognitive system impact:**
- [ ] **🧠 Cerebral Functions**: Executive decisions compromised
