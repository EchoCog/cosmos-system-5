## ⚙️ Autonomic Function Affected

**Neurological Mapping**: This issue affects the Autonomic Nervous System (Background Processes & Emotive Balance)

- [ ] **📊 System Monitoring (M-1)** - Continuous health and performance monitoring
- [ ] **💾 State Management (S-8)** - Limbic system state and configuration
- [ ] **🔧 Process Orchestration (PD-2)** - Background workflow coordination
- [ ] **❤️ Emotive Processing (P-5)** - Emotional context and intuitive processing
- [ ] **⚡ Automatic Responses (T-7)** - Trigger-based reactions and reflexes

## 🔍 System Description

**What background or autonomic function is not working?**

Describe the specific monitoring, state management, or automatic process that is failing.

## ⚙️ Expected Autonomic Behavior

**What should the system be doing automatically?**

Detail the expected background process, monitoring, or emotional response.

## 🚫 Actual Autonomic Behavior

**What is the system actually doing instead?**

Describe the current (incorrect) autonomic behavior or missing automatic response.

## 💓 Autonomic Context

**System health and background processing details:**
- **Process type**: (e.g., health monitoring, state sync, background maintenance)
- **Trigger condition**: (e.g., threshold breach, time-based, event-driven)
- **Expected response**: (e.g., alert, adjustment, recovery action)
- **Actual response**: (e.g., no response, incorrect action, delayed reaction)
- **System vitals**: (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, network status)

## ⚙️ Neurological Context

- **Service affected**: (e.g., monitoring-service, state-management-service)
- **Port**: (e.g., 3021, 3022, 3023, 3024, 3025)
- **Brain region**: Autonomic Triad - Limbic/Autonomic Systems
- **Function type**: (e.g., monitoring, state, orchestration, emotive, trigger)
- **Autonomic mode**: (e.g., sympathetic, parasympathetic, balanced)

## 🔄 Reproduction Steps

1. Monitor system state via `http://localhost:302X/...`
2. Trigger autonomic condition by...
3. Observe background processing response...
4. Check automatic trigger activation...
5. Verify state management consistency...

## 📊 Autonomic Impact Assessment

**System Health Impact:**
- [ ] **🔴 Critical**: System homeostasis failure (vital functions affected)
- [ ] **🟠 High**: Compromised autonomic function (major system instability)
- [ ] **🟡 Medium**: Suboptimal background processing (minor stability issues)
- [ ] **🟢 Low**: Minor autonomic quirk (cosmetic monitoring issue)

## 🌐 Cross-Triad Effects

**Does this affect other brain regions?**
- [ ] **🧠 Cerebral Triad**: Executive functions or decision-making impacted
- [ ] **🤖 Somatic Triad**: Motor control or behavioral responses affected
- [ ] **🌐 Integration Layer**: System-wide communication or coordination issues

## 💓 Autonomic Patterns

**Specific autonomic behaviors affected:**
- [ ] **Sympathetic Response**: Active alertness, immediate reactions, stress response
- [ ] **Parasympathetic Response**: Rest, maintenance, optimization functions
- [ ] **Emotive Processing**: Emotional context, intuitive feelings, mood regulation
- [ ] **Homeostatic Control**: System balance, resource allocation, stability maintenance

## 📈 System Metrics

**Current autonomic vital signs:**
- **CPU Usage**: %
- **Memory Usage**: %
- **Response Times**: ms
- **Error Rates**: %
- **Health Score**: /100
- **Trigger Sensitivity**: (high/medium/low)

## 🕒 Temporal Patterns

**When does this autonomic issue occur?**
- [ ] **Continuously**: Persistent autonomic dysfunction
- [ ] **Periodically**: Regular intervals (specify frequency)
- [ ] **Under Load**: High system stress conditions
- [ ] **During Maintenance**: Background processing periods
- [ ] **Event-Triggered**: Specific conditions or thresholds
