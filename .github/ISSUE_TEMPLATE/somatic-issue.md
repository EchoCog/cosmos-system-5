## 🤖 Motor Function Affected

**Neurological Mapping**: This issue affects the Basal System (Somatic Balance & Performance)

- [ ] **🕹️ Action Coordination (M-1)** - Motor control and movement sequencing
- [ ] **👁️ Sensory Processing (S-8)** - Environmental input and perception
- [ ] **🧠 Behavioral Implementation (P-5)** - Behavioral technique execution  
- [ ] **📡 Response Delivery (O-4)** - Motor output and action execution

## 🎯 Behavioral Description

**What motor or behavioral function is not working?**

Describe the specific action, behavior, or sensory processing that is failing.

## 🤖 Expected Motor Behavior

**What action should the system be performing?**

Detail the expected behavioral response or motor coordination.

## 🚫 Actual Motor Behavior

**What is the system actually doing instead?**

Describe the current (incorrect) behavioral response.

## 👁️ Sensory Context

**Environmental and input processing details:**
- **Input type**: (e.g., HTTP request, sensor data, environmental signal)
- **Processing stage**: (e.g., reception, interpretation, coordination, execution)
- **Response expected**: (e.g., motor action, behavioral adaptation, output delivery)
- **Response received**: (e.g., error, delayed response, incorrect action)

## 🤖 Neurological Context

- **Service affected**: (e.g., motor-control-service, sensory-service)
- **Port**: (e.g., 3011, 3012, 3013, 3014)
- **Brain region**: Somatic Triad - Basal System
- **Function type**: (e.g., motor, sensory, behavioral, response)
- **Performance level**: (e.g., optimal, degraded, failing)

## 🔄 Reproduction Steps

1. Send behavioral request to `http://localhost:301X/...`
2. Trigger motor coordination via...
3. Observe sensory processing response...
4. Check behavioral output delivery...
5. Note any coordination failures...

## 📊 Motor Impact Assessment

**Behavioral Function Impact:**
- [ ] **🔴 Critical**: Cannot perform essential actions (motor failure)
- [ ] **🟠 High**: Severely reduced motor function (major behavioral errors)
- [ ] **🟡 Medium**: Suboptimal behavioral responses (coordination issues)
- [ ] **🟢 Low**: Minor behavioral quirk (timing or precision issue)

## 🌐 Cross-Triad Effects

**Does this affect other brain regions?**
- [ ] **🧠 Cerebral Triad**: Executive decisions or analytical processing affected
- [ ] **⚙️ Autonomic Triad**: Background monitoring or state management impacted
- [ ] **🌐 Integration Layer**: API Gateway or cross-system communication issues

## 🎮 Motor Coordination Details

**Specific behavioral patterns affected:**
- [ ] **Adaptive Behaviors**: Environmental navigation, context responses
- [ ] **Reactive Behaviors**: Emergency responses, obstacle avoidance  
- [ ] **Learned Behaviors**: Pattern-based actions, optimization routines
- [ ] **Instinctive Behaviors**: Default responses, failsafe mechanisms
