## 🧠 Cognitive Function Affected

**Neurological Mapping**: This issue affects the Neocortex (Executive Functions)

- [ ] **💡 Thought Generation (T-7)** - Right Hemisphere intuitive ideas
- [ ] **🎯 Processing Coordination (PD-2)** - Central executive control  
- [ ] **⚡ Analytical Processing (P-5)** - Complex reasoning and analysis
- [ ] **📤 Output Formatting (O-4)** - Left Hemisphere applied techniques

## 🔍 Symptom Description

**What cognitive function is not working as expected?**

Describe the specific executive function or reasoning process that is failing.

## 🎯 Expected Cognitive Behavior

**What should the system be thinking or outputting?**

Detail the expected cognitive process and results.

## 🚫 Actual Cognitive Behavior  

**What is the system actually doing instead?**

Describe the current (incorrect) cognitive behavior.

## 🧠 Neurological Context

- **Service affected**: (e.g., thought-service, processing-director)
- **Port**: (e.g., 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004)
- **Brain region**: Cerebral Triad - Neocortex
- **Processing type**: (e.g., intuitive, analytical, coordinative, formatting)
- **Cognitive load**: (e.g., low, medium, high)

## 🔄 Reproduction Steps

1. Send cognitive request to `http://localhost:300X/...`
2. Observe executive function response from...
3. Compare expected vs actual reasoning...
4. Note any cross-triad communication issues...

## 📊 Impact Assessment

**Cognitive Function Impact:**
- [ ] **🔴 Critical**: System cannot think or reason (executive failure)
- [ ] **🟠 High**: Severely reduced cognitive function (major reasoning errors) 
- [ ] **🟡 Medium**: Suboptimal cognitive processing (minor logic issues)
- [ ] **🟢 Low**: Minor cognitive quirk (cosmetic reasoning issue)

## 🌐 Cross-Triad Effects

**Does this affect other brain regions?**
- [ ] **🤖 Somatic Triad**: Motor control or behavioral responses affected
- [ ] **⚙️ Autonomic Triad**: Background processing or monitoring impacted
- [ ] **🌐 Integration Layer**: API Gateway or event bus communication issues

**Neurological Note**: This issue template follows the cognitive architecture where the Cerebral Triad mirrors the Neocortex's executive functions including strategic thinking, analysis, and intelligent output generation as shown in the System-5-CNS-ORG.png diagram.
