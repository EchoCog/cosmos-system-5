# Machine Learning Core

The Machine Learning Core provides shared ML capabilities across all triads in the Cognitive Cities Architecture. This implements the **Advanced Features** phase of development with predictive analytics, pattern recognition, and adaptive learning.

## Features

### 🧠 Predictive Analytics
- Predictive monitoring for system health
- Performance forecasting
- Resource usage prediction
- Anomaly prediction and early warning

### 🔍 Pattern Recognition
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- System interaction patterns
- Performance optimization patterns
- User behavior patterns

### 🎯 Adaptive Learning
- Continuous learning from system data
- Adaptive threshold management
- Self-optimizing configurations
- Dynamic resource allocation

### 🔧 Cross-Triad Optimization
- Inter-triad communication optimization
- Resource sharing optimization
- Coordination efficiency improvements
- System-wide performance tuning

## Architecture

The ML Core follows a distributed architecture that supports each triad's specific needs:
